# ðŸ§  Text Vectorizer using Bag-of-Words (Python + scikit-learn)

This project demonstrates a simple **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** based text vectorization pipeline using **Python** and **scikit-learn**. It takes a list of short text reviews, performs basic preprocessing, and converts the text into a numerical matrix using `CountVectorizer`.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Lowercases and cleans punctuation from text
- âœ… Tokenizes sentences into words
- âœ… Builds a vocabulary
- âœ… Outputs the BoW matrix for each sentence

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `re` â€“ for text cleaning  
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ for CountVectorizer
